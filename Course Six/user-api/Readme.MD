# User API â€“ RESTful Service with Node.js and Express

A simple RESTful API for managing a list of users.  
Built with **Node.js** and **Express**, it demonstrates routing, middleware, HTTP methods, error handling, and using an in-memory data source.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- **CRUD operations** for users
  - `GET /users` â€“ fetch all users
  - `GET /users/:id` â€“ fetch one user by ID
  - `POST /user` â€“ create a new user
  - `PUT /user/:id` â€“ update existing user
  - `DELETE /user/:id` â€“ delete user by ID
- **Middleware**
  - Logging middleware: logs method, URL, status code, and duration
  - Validation middleware: checks `firstName`, `lastName`, `hobby` for POST & PUT
- **Error handling**
  - Returns `400`, `404`, `200`, `201` with clear error JSON
- **In-memory storage**
  - Users stored in an array (no database required)
- **Pre-seeded with 10 random users** for testing
